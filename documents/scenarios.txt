Scenarios

1. Users can read a novel
  If the user does not already have a novel to read in mind they have several choices, all of which are listed under the explore
  dropdown located in the navbar. The first choice is the 'top-rated' button which consists of the most well received novels on the 
  website. The user can sort through novels by most viewed, most followed, highest rated, etc... The second choice for a user
  looking for something to read, is the 'library' button. The library consists of every novel stored in the website's database
  and a user will be able to navigate through these novels using pagination buttons at the bottom right of the screen. The last
  option in the explore dropdown is the 'random' button. This button will pull a random novel from the database, the user can
  continually use the random button until a suitable novel is found.

2. Users can write a novel
  To begin writing a novel, the user can click the 'write' button located in the middle of the navbar. After clicking write, the
  user will be redirected to their personal novel page which will display all of their currently created novels. In order to proceed,
  the user will need to click on a novel for which to write to, or in the case the user has yet to create a novel, they will need to
  press the create novel button. The process of creating a novel will include, giving the novel a title (required), several
  tags (optional), a description (optional), and a novel cover (optional). Once the user is finished filling out the novel's information,
  they will press the 'create' button, finalizing the creation of their novel. Now that the user has a novel to write to, they can once again
  click the 'write' button, and then click the novel they have just created in their personal novel page. The user will be redirected one
  final time to a text editor that consists of a chapter title, and chapter contents. Once the user is satisfied with whatever they have written
  in the chapter contents, they can press submit and the chapter will be posted to their novel.

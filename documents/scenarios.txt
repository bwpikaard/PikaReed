Scenarios

1. Users can read a novel
  If the user does not already have a novel to read in mind they have several choices, all of which are listed under the explore
  dropdown located in the navbar. The first choice is the 'top-rated' button which consists of the most well received novels on the 
  website. The user can sort through novels by most viewed, most followed, highest rated, etc... The second choice for a user
  looking for something to read, is the 'library' button. The library consists of every novel stored in the website's database
  and a user will be able to navigate through these novels using pagination buttons at the bottom right of the screen. The last
  option in the explore dropdown is the 'random' button. This button will pull a random novel from the database, the user can
  continually use the random button until a suitable novel is found. If a user does have a novel in mind, they can enter the 
  novel title in the search bar in the top right of the screen. After clicking enter, the user will be redirected to a list of
  novels that have a similar title to the one the user entered, the user can then click the correct novel and then begin reading.

2. Users can write a novel
  To begin writing a novel, the user can click the 'write' button located in the middle of the navbar. After clicking write, the
  user will be redirected to their personal novel page which will display all of their currently created novels. In order to proceed,
  the user will need to click on a novel for which to write to, or in the case the user has yet to create a novel, they will need to
  press the create novel button. The process of creating a novel will include, giving the novel a title (required), several
  tags (optional), a description (optional), and a novel cover (optional). Once the user is finished filling out the novel's information,
  they will press the 'create' button, finalizing the creation of their novel. Now that the user has a novel to write to, they can once again
  click the 'write' button, and then click the novel they have just created in their personal novel page. The user will be redirected one
  final time to a text editor that consists of a chapter title, and chapter contents. Once the user is satisfied with whatever they have written
  in the chapter contents, they can press submit and the chapter will be posted to their novel.
  
3. Users can conversate in the comments section
  At the end of each chapter will be a comments section. Users will be able to fill out a text area input box with whatever they wish to talk about, whether
  that be about the chapter they have just finished reading, or in response to other user comments. For each comment, other users will have the option
  to 'reply', which will create a child comment on the parent comment. For this reason, users will be able to view and revist their own comments by
  clicking their profile icon, then pressing the 'profile' button, and finally navigating to the 'comments' section in their profile. This section
  will display all of the users comments by date, newest to oldest, and clicking on a comment will redirect the user to the chapter they commented on.
  
4. Trusted users' abilities
  
5. A select number of the trusted users will have even more authority
  
6. Trusted users can give corrections on a chapter
  
7. Users can give a review and rating of a novel
  After reading several chapters of a novel, users will have the option to give a review and rate the novel. In order to do this, users will need to
  navigate to the novel's homepage. The process of rating a novel is simple, as there will be five transparent stars at the top of the page near
  the novel title that the user can click to rate the novel. Scrolling to the bottom of the novel homepage, a user will see the review section. At the top of
  the review section will be an input form requiring a review title and review content. After filling out the required information, the user will click
  submit and their review will be posted in the review section of that novel. 

8. Users can provide feedback to the website
  Located in the navbar at the top of the screen will be a feedback button that will allow users to contact staff if needed. Some reasons to contact staff
  include: bugs, locked out of an account, another user claiming a novel is theirs when it is not, and users can also inform staff on where the website can
  be improved. The structure of the feedback form will be: a section for the user to put their email so that staff can contact the user even if they are 
  locked out of an account, a subject area so whoever is reading the feedback report will understand it more clearly, and finally there will be a content
  section for the user to describe the problem more clearly. Some users who are bored can use this by searching the website for bugs in order to shame the 
  two developers, or users can suggest features to make the developers lose more sleep.

9. Users can look through the provided resources to better their writing

10. New writers can get their novel displayed on the front page carousel
